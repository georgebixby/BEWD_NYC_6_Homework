Final Project Proposal

I want to create an app which helps people developing products to prioritize new features. Based on the Kano model (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kano_model), "testers" would be asked to respond to two questions about new features:

1. How would you feel if this feature was present?
2. How would you feel if this feature wasn't present?

Their answer options would include: satisfied, neutral or dissatisfied.

Based on these their answers, each feature could be assigned to a category: required, desired, exciter/delighter, neutral, or anti-feature, which a product team can use to help figure out which features would have the best ROI.

I think there will need to be an admin role, which is someone who can create "Projects" which have many "Features." Each feature will have a description, and likely an image.

There will also need to be a "Tester" role, and each tester will be linked to a "response" for each question about a feature.

A possible api integration with a project management tool such as Trello is possible, where card titles can be used as "features", avoiding duplicate entries.
